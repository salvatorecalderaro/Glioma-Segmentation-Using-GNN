# Glioma-Segmentation-Using-GNN
This repository provides a new graph-based deep learning approach for glioma segmentation. It is based on constructing a graph starting from an MRI scan and then employing a Graph Neural Network.

## Dataset
The dataset used for our experimental activity is publicly available at: [https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mateuszbuda/lgg-mri-segmentation]()
